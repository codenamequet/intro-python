## Data Types <a id="data-types"></a>

There are the following data types in python:
* Strings `str()`
* Intergers `int()` (truncates to whole number)
* Floats `float()`
* Booleans `bool()`
* NoneType `None`

`type` can tell you the type of an object
`print` will print value out to shell (python version of console.log()

#### Operators on ints and floats
Addition, subtraction, and multiplication: 
* If both are ints results are ints.
* If either or both are floats, results is float
Division:
`a/b` results in a float
int division `a//b` results in int,  quotient with out a remainder
